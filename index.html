                <details open><summary>My Childhood</summary>
                <p> I was born on July 3rd in Ho Chi Minh city, lived my first few years of childhood in China, so my mother tongue is Mandarin, the funniest thing is Vietnamese isn't even my main language even though i live in Vietnam, it's English, Mandarin, Cantonese and Vietnamese in that order. Enough of that, i enjoy animating, 3D rendering and Cook up something fun, either in games or in culinary. Anyways, hope you have a nice day mate.</p></details>
